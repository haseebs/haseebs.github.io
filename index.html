          <p>We present a novel extension to embedding-based knowl- edge graph completion models which enables them to per- form open-world link prediction, i.e. to predict facts for en- tities unseen in training based on their textual description. Our model combines a regular link prediction model learned from a knowledge graph with word embeddings learned from a textual corpus. After training both independently, we learn a transformation to map the embeddings of an entity’s name and description to the graph-based embedding space.
            In experiments on several datasets including FB20k, DBPe- dia50k and our new dataset FB15k-237-OWE, we demon- strate competitive results. Particularly, our approach exploits the full knowledge graph structure even when textual descrip- tions are scarce, does not require a joint training on graph and text, and can be applied to any embedding-based link predic- tion model, such as TransE, ComplEx and DistMult.</p>

          <p>The ability to learn from incrementally arriving data is essential for
            any life-long learning system. However, standard deep neural networks 
            suffer from catastrophic forgetting when they are trained incrementally.
            We explore the use of Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (AC-GAN) as an alternative
            to storing exemplars for incremental learning of classifiers. We show that
            the classifier learned by knowledge distillation from older model
            is biased and propose a way to remove this bias by distilling knowledge from 
            auxiliary classifier of AC-GAN. Experiments on MNIST show that this method is 
            comparable to current state of the art approaches which rely on exemplars.
            Additionally, we perform ablation studies and discuss the limitations of this approach. </p>

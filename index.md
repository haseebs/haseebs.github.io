Hi! I am Haseeb Shah, a BS Software Engineering student at NUST (National 
University of Science and Technology), Pakistan. Currently, I am working 
as an intern at [TUKL-NUST R&D Centre](http://tukl.seecs.nust.edu.pk), 
where my work is primarily focused on research and implementation of 
Machine Learning models to solvea specific task. I have put this website 
up to share information about my projects that I have worked on over the years.

Head over to the [Projects page](/projects.html) to see details about my projects.
